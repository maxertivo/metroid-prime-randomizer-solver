# metroid-prime-randomizer-solver
Checks logs generated by Claris's Metroid Prime Randomizer to see if they are completable. Works for warp and/or elevator randomization. Also works for vanilla randomization.

# Usage

Just run the executable and answer the prompts. When providing the log directory, Windows-style filepaths (i.e. filepaths with backslash instead of slash) should work.
When providing a single log file, the file must end with the .txt file extension.

# Difficulty levels

* Easy - Does not require any tricks. It is unlikely that any seed will be completable with this difficulty unless several items are non-randomized.
* Medium - Requires some easy tricks, but no dashing. It is unlikely that any seed will be completable with this difficulty unless several items are non-randomized.
* Hard - Intended to be completable by Any%/100% speedrunners. Some easier secret worlds are required. No difficult bomb jumps (HBJs, UBJs) are required.
* Very Hard - Intended to be completable by Low% speedrunners. Requires some difficult bomb jumps and generally does not require Space Jump.
* Expert - Adds some lengthy out-of-bounds traversal as well as incredibly tedious tricks (notably Tallon Floaty in Landing Site)

# Limitations
In some cases, the solver won't be able to find a solution even though a solution exists. This is usually due to it "using up" a warp that it needs later. However, the solver should (hopefully) never say a seed is completable when it is not.

Some seeds are techically completable, but can become impossible if the warps are used in the wrong order. The solver will still say such seeds are completable.

Warps to Elder Chamber can cause issues because the statue blocks the exit. You can collect the item to leave one time, but if you get warped a second time, you are trapped. In rare cases, the solver may collect the Elder Chamber item early and be unable to solve the seed.

Currently, some removable barriers in the game are treated as being one-way (e.g. the barrier in Metroid Quarantine A).

Boss difficulty is not considered at all.

Floaty jump is not considered, unless it is able to be acquired repeatedly, since a one-time usage trick makes the logic too complex. Tallon Floaty is the only example of floaty that can be required (and only on Expert difficulty).

Magmoor Traversals without heat protection are allowed, but the e-tank requirements are only approximate. Also, most e-tank requirements assume warps are enabled, so they may not be accurate for non-warps seeds.

# Compiling from source
First, install GHC on your machine, and make sure the GHC executable is added to your PATH variable if needed. Running the following GHC command from the root of the project will compile the code and place all of the compiled files into a folder called "build":

ghc app/Main.hs --make -O2 -i"./src" -hidir "./build" -odir "./build" -o ./build/metroid-prime-randomizer-solver

Alternatively, you can use the "build-run.bat" batchfile to compile and run the application. Or, if you have Haskell Cabal installed, you can compile and run the application using:

cabal run main

# Customizing Tricks / Room Requirements
If you want to modify this code to change room / item requirements, you'll mostly need to edit two files: Predicates.hs, and Graph.hs. Have fun.
