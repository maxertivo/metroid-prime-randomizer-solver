# mp-warps-rando-checker
Checks logs generated by Claris's Metroid Prime Randomizer to see if they are completable. Works for warps and non-warps.

# Difficulty levels

* Easy - Does not require any tricks. It is unlikely that any seed will be completable with this difficulty unless several items are non-randomized.
* Medium - Requires some easy tricks, but no dashing. It is unlikely that any seed will be completable with this difficulty unless several items are non-randomized.
* Hard - Intended to be completable by Any%/100% speedrunners. Some easier secret worlds are required. No difficult bomb jumps (HBJs, UBJs) are required.
* Very Hard - Intended to be completable by Low% speedrunners. Requires some difficult bomb jumps and generally does not require Space Jump.
* Extreme - Adds some lengthy out-of-bounds traversal as well as incredibly tedious tricks (notably Tallon Floaty in Landing Site)

# Limitations
Currently, many removable barriers in the game are treated as being one-way (e.g. the barrier in Metroid Quarantine A).

Currently, the Sunchamber Ghosts item doesn't require you to collect the Flaahgra item and Elite Research Phazon Elite item doesn't require you to collect the PB Maze item.

You can only warp to Ruined Fountain if you haven't collected the item. This is because warping to Ruined Fountain warps you on top of the item. The checker treats subsequent warps to Ruined Fountain as though you cannot leave the room.

Boss difficulty is not considered at all.

Floaty jump is not considered, unless it is able to be acquired repeatedly, since a one-time usage trick makes the logic too complex. Tallon Floaty is the only example of floaty that can be required.

Magmoor Traversals without heat protection are allowed, but the e-tank requirements are only approximate.
